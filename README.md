Using JAR for Device Protocol

For devices that only support custom data protocols or specific industry protocols, the raw data can be accessed through a custom protocol gateway, which can be converted into EnOS IoT format or other formats required by downstream modules or applications. 

IoT Hub can provide the processing of device protocols to the EnOS IoT standard protocol through a JAR file.
